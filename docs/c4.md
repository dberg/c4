## 1.0 C4

C4 is a collection of tools that provide syntax highlighting and indentation for java, scala and compiled class files for the JVM. It includes two emacs modes: c4j-mode and c4s-mode for java and scala. The emacs modes communicate with the c4 server to parse buffers and get information about a project.


## 2.0 Server

The server is responsible for the data flow between clients and projects residing on the server. The server implementation uses kqueue in bsd platforms and osx, and epoll when running on linux. The data passed between clients and the server is serialized and deserialized using Protocol Buffers. The messages are represented in the classes Request and Response which are auto-generated by the Protocol Buffer compiler.

The server maintains a RequestBuffer object per connection until it has the complete data to form a Requests object. After a request object is built the server delivers the request to the ProjectHandler object. The ProjectHandler object is responsible to deliver the request to its project. If no project exists the ProjectHandler creates one.

The project process the request and returns a Response object which the server delivers to the client.


### 2.1 Data stream

The bytestream sent between the client and the server is serialized and deserialized using the auto-generated classes Request and Response. The first 4 bytes in the bytestream indicates the length of the serialized Request or Response data in network byte order.


###  2.2 Request

Every request must set the attributes "projectId" and "action". The projectId attribute must be generated by the client and it should be unique per project. The action attribute can be of two types: PROJECT and COMPILE.

PROJECT: A client issues this method to query the status of the project. The server will indicate if it has all the compilation units of the project and if not which symbols are missing.

COMPILE: The client issues this method to send a list of compilation units to be parsed by the project.


### 2.3 Response

A response consists of a response code and a body. The response code indicates if a request terminated in success or error.

If the response code is an error the body contains an error message. And if the response code is success the body contains information depending on the action of the request.

If the action is PROJECT the body of the response contains information about the project. If the action is COMPILE the body of the response contains information about the list of compilation units processed by the server.


## 3.0 Projects

A project instance is identified by a projectId that is generated by the client. A project consists of 3 specialized projects: JavaProject, ScalaProject and BytecodeProject.

A java or scala project instance contains a list of compilation units. Each compilation unit has information about a filename like the filename, a symbol table, syntax highlighting and indentation information.

The BytecodeProject can be used by the client to inspect .class files or compiled libraries that a java or scala project might import.
